# BoringOS Website - Remaining Tasks

## High Priority (Blocks Launch)

### Screenshots Needed (17 total)
Without these, the site violates its own "Show. Don't explain." principle.

**Homepage (1)**
- [ ] Desktop screenshot (dock, wallpaper, nothing open)

**What Is This page (4)**
- [ ] Desktop screenshot
- [ ] Browser screenshot
- [ ] Files app screenshot
- [ ] Document (LibreOffice Writer) screenshot

**How It Works page (3)**
- [ ] Balena Etcher screenshot
- [ ] Installer screenshot
- [ ] BoringOS desktop (post-install) screenshot

**What's Included page (9)**
- [ ] Firefox with webpage
- [ ] Thunderbird inbox
- [ ] LibreOffice Writer with document
- [ ] LibreOffice Calc with spreadsheet
- [ ] Photo viewer with image
- [ ] Video player
- [ ] Music player
- [ ] Files app
- [ ] Games (Chess or similar)

### GitHub Release
- [ ] Build and publish actual .iso file to https://github.com/getboring/boringos/releases
- [ ] Verify download link works

## Medium Priority (Post-Launch Improvements)

### Dedicated Download Page
Create `/download` page that:
- [ ] Shows single clear "Download .iso" button
- [ ] Displays file size and version
- [ ] Links directly to .iso (not GitHub releases page)
- [ ] Reduces friction for non-technical users

### Analytics
- [ ] Add privacy-respecting analytics (Plausible, Fathom, or similar)
- [ ] Track download button clicks
- [ ] Monitor drop-off points

### Social Proof (when available)
- [ ] Add GitHub stars badge
- [ ] Add download counter
- [ ] Collect and display user testimonials

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Custom domain setup (user mentioned handling later)
- [ ] Open Graph images for social sharing
- [ ] Favicon in multiple sizes (currently just SVG)
- [ ] Print stylesheet
